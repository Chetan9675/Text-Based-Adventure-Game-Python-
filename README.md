# Text-Based-Adventure-Game-Python
A choose-your-own-adventure game where the player makes decisions that affect the story.
No external libraries neededâ€”just pure Python!

How It Works
Intro: Sets the scene in a dark forest with two paths.
Choices:
Path 1 (Woods): Fight a wolf or run away.
Path 2 (Cottage): Accept a drink or refuse.
Multiple Endings: Each choice leads to victory or defeat.
Replayability: Asks if the player wants to try again

Possible Expansions
Add an inventory system (e.g., weapons, keys).
Introduce random events (e.g., traps, hidden items).
Extend the story with more locations.

THANK YOU!!!!!!
